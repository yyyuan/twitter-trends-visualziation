# Twitter Trends Visualization
This is the visualziation in processing to visualize the location based twitter trends data. 
*The documentation folder includes a screenshot for the visualization and a gif for short demo*

## Current Data Set
The current visualized data set is the data collected on 2/22/2015. The data was collected for 60 cities around United States, with each city's top three Twitter trends at a specific time. I didn't spend much time cleaning the data format, so the trends were in the raw format returned by Twitter.
